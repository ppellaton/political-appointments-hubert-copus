This codebook describes the variables contained in the main district court 
dataset we analyze in the article. To create this dataset, we merged data from
the FJC's Integrated Database (IDB) with original data we collected from docket
sheets available in each district court's electronic databases.

We will not describe the FJC IDB variables in detail here, and instead refer 
readers to the comprehensive codebooks available at 
[https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb](https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb). For the 
analysis in this article, we used data from three separate IDB datasets:

1. The **IDB Civil 1988-present** database contains all civil cases filed in 
   U.S. District Courts from 1988, and is available at 
   [https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb/interactive/IDB-civil-since-1988](https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb/interactive/IDB-civil-since-1988).  
2. The **IDB Appeals 1971-2007** database contains all appeals filed in 
   U.S. Courts of Appeals from 1971-2007, and is available at 
   [https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb/interactive/IDB-appeals-1971-2007](https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb/interactive/IDB-appeals-1971-2007).
3. The **IDB Appeals 2008-present** database contains all appeals filed in 
   U.S. Courts of Appeals from 2008, and is available at 
   [https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb/interactive/IDB-appeals-since-2008](https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb/interactive/IDB-appeals-since-2008).

Since our analysis spans from the 1990s to the early 2010s, we merged the two 
IDB Appeals databases to cover our analysis time period. We preserved PDF copies 
of the FJC's codebooks for each of these datasets in this repository.

For additional details about the data collection and cleaning process, please 
see the article and the online appendix.
